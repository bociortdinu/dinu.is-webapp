### New version ðŸš§

I'm currently working on a new portfolio to replace this old one, but since many people's still visiting this one today, I decided to refactor it and make this code more re-usable for all of you. So please be patient! 

I'll publish a new versions built with React Hooks and Vue's composition API. 
The main idea will be to allow you guys to re-use/build animated components easily on your own projects, based on GSAP 3 and ScrollTrigger.
